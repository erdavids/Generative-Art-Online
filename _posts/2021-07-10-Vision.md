It's easy to look at the path our lives are on and draw a trajectory towards a future point and call it "Vision".

That's not it.

Vision is about seeing what cannot be predicted right now.

Vision is seeing a future that can only become reality through a shift in your current actions.

This isn't a forecast based on current clues. It goes far beyond that.

Have the courage to imagine something that doesn't already exist, even if those things are your own choices and personality traits.

You can't create it if you can't imagine it.
