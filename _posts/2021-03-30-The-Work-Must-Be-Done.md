We have the ability to create things because the work must be done.

You have the ability to work on your goals because the work must be done.

You will be able to write the next page of your book because the work must be done.

Other people are doing the work that must be done as well. They're not doing the work that you have to do, they're doing their own. Focus on what comes next, accept that these goals have been given to you along with the potential to accomplish them, and get to work. It must be done.
