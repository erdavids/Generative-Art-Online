It always feels like the map has been completely filled in.

All the islands have been charted, the paths are clear, all the efficiencies found.

And then suddenly, someone finds something that either wasn't there before, or always was and no one else noticed.

They found it because they were there.

Never let the progress and achievements and discoveries of others keep you away from the parts of the map that are already filled in.

There's something there that no one else has found.
