These principles are heavily tied to perfectionism, and all the issues that it introduces.

The goal is not to create something that is perfect, but rather create something that is imperfect and then improve it.

A great way to practice this is by creating [Generative Art](https://github.com/erdavids/Generative-Art), which in my experience has been writing scripts that programmatically generate interesting visuals. The important part is introducing randomness. It could be as simple as some of the shapes rendering at random sizes, or a completely random color palette. 

The goal is for the end result to be a surprise. If you're surprised, then almost immediately you will have new ideas come to you. It's very difficult for own work to surprise us unless we let it.
