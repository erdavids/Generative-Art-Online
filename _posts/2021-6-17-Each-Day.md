The old goal was to make a little progress every day until you reach the desired achievement. The new goal is to find your threshold is for sustainable daily progress that could even extend beyond.

What is the level of effort that you can put in each day, every day, for 30 days? 60 days? 150 days?

Find that limit, or starting point, and build from there. It's your foundation, and it will result in much more than you realize.
