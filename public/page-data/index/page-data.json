So often it feels like we're in a battle for new ideas and fresh takes on what we need to do.</p>\n<p>Many times the answer is in the work. Do the work, and the work will help you find the next steps.</p>\n<p>But there's another thing we can try by letting the work actually do itself. It's tricky to make this happen in every discipline, but it's definitely possible with art and just another tool against perfectionism.</p>\n<p>At first we think that the goal around creating things is to create something that is perfect, but that's not the right starting point. The goal is not to create something that is perfect, but rather create something that is imperfect and then improve it.</p>\n<p>If we have something as a base, as a starting point, not only can we get to that point faster, but it can provide a jumping board to new ideas and endeavors in a way that we could never achieve on our own with a blank whiteboard.</p>\n<p>A great way to practice this is by playing around with <a href=\"https://github.com/erdavids/Generative-Art\">Generative Art</a>, which in my experience has been writing scripts that programmatically generate interesting visuals. At it's base level, you're writing code that will draw lines and shapes on a canvas in as complicated ways as you can design. The important part is introducing randomness. It could be as simple as some of the shapes rendering at random sizes, or as complex as randomized color palette.</p>\n<p>Whatever I've done with Generative Art always leads down so many branches of ideas and projects. A partially finished piece will usually spark some ideas that take off on their own. If I simply sit with a piece of paper and try to plan out multiple generative pieces however, most likely I'll hit a blank.</p>\n<p>The goal is for the end result to be a surprise. If you're surprised, then almost immediately you will have new ideas come to you. Move fast, let the work do itself when you can, trust yourself, and see what happens.

With a blog for example, I'm imagining thousands of daily readers and published collections sitting on the shelf, all available to me if I had only started sooner.</p>\n<p>Not only is this not true (it could be, but doubtful), it's a dangerous mentality that could easily block me from ever starting or pursuing anything at all. Starting something now does not mean I have less energy available to give it than if I had started sooner. Furthermore, it's a disservice to myself to only focus on the things that I have yet to start and ignore the things I have already done.</p>\n<p>So I am aware of how easily I compare my initial interest in a pursuit against the accumulated skill of seasoned experts, but I have another belief that outweighs the first. It's also extremely unreasonable, but in a way that enables me to try things, and fail in a way that pushes me forward as a human being. It's the belief that whatever I decide to do, I can do.</p>\n<p>That's all I need. I really just want to be willing to <strong>attempt</strong>. Results aren't as important to me. What matters most is that I'm willing to live a life full of effort. A discussion can be had around what is worth continuing with and what deserves to be cut loose, but at the beginning of things, when I feel strong emotion towards possibility, I need to see action and not hesitation.</p>\n<p>This is the first post in what I am initially intending to be a daily blog. I'm approaching it as kind of a journal used to document my thoughts, beliefs, projects, triumphs, and failures. I recognize the importance of choosing a niche, so the niche I've chosen for now is my collection of interests. At times they can be pretty broad, but I think they're connected by relevant themes, and I'm excited to explore them.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what form that will take as things continue, but the goal is to keep things brief and instinctive, and never take it too seriously. Thinking ahead, I would be excited to have even one month's history of successful posts, so I plan to just start there.</p>\n<p>The awesome thing is that by just writing this first post, my productive belief has won out against my limiting one.
