With a blog for example, I'm imagining thousands of daily readers and published collections sitting on the shelf, all available to me if I had only started sooner.</p>\n<p>Not only is this not true (it could be, but doubtful), it's a dangerous mentality that could easily block me from ever starting or pursuing anything at all. Starting something now does not mean I have less energy available to give it than if I had started sooner. Furthermore, it's a disservice to myself to only focus on the things that I have yet to start and ignore the things I have already done.</p>\n<p>So I am aware of how easily I compare my initial interest in a pursuit against the accumulated skill of seasoned experts, but I have another belief that outweighs the first. It's also extremely unreasonable, but in a way that enables me to try things, and fail in a way that pushes me forward as a human being. It's the belief that whatever I decide to do, I can do.</p>\n<p>That's all I need. I really just want to be willing to <strong>attempt</strong>. Results aren't as important to me. What matters most is that I'm willing to live a life full of effort. A discussion can be had around what is worth continuing with and what deserves to be cut loose, but at the beginning of things, when I feel strong emotion towards possibility, I need to see action and not hesitation.</p>\n<p>This is the first post in what I am initially intending to be a daily blog. I'm approaching it as kind of a journal used to document my thoughts, beliefs, projects, triumphs, and failures. I recognize the importance of choosing a niche, so the niche I've chosen for now is my collection of interests. At times they can be pretty broad, but I think they're connected by relevant themes, and I'm excited to explore them.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what form that will take as things continue, but the goal is to keep things brief and instinctive, and never take it too seriously. Thinking ahead, I would be excited to have even one month's history of successful posts, so I plan to just start there.</p>\n<p>The awesome thing is that by just writing this first post, my productive belief has won out against my limiting one. I have written a blog post that no one will read (for now), and I will always prefer that to having nothing for them to read at all.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"03/29/21","slug":"/blog/starting-a-blog-in-2021","title":"Starting a Daily Blog in 2021","thought":true,"article":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4650024b-04df-5929-99fd-410f38a220fc","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/starting-a-blog-in-2021","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
