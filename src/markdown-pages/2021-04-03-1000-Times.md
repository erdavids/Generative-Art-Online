Can you think of something that you've done more than 1000 times? The first thing that pops into your head is good enough.

Now think through the last time you can remember adding tangible improvement to the process of that action.

Some things may not need to be improved, but they still deserve the evaluation.

If you're feeling adventurous, find a way to change the thing you've done 1000 times, and do it completely differently when you can. Shake things up and see how you react.
