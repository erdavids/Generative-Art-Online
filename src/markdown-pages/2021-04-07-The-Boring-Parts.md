Try and remember the boring parts of the things you work on. They usually fall through the cracks as memories are built and things get romanticized.

These tedious details represent all the achievements throughout your endeavors. Each project isn't just the sum of it parts, but a long list of individually worthy accomplishments.

Also, these tedious moments will reappear, so the better you can remember them, the better you can overcome them in the future.
