I used to finish every book I started reading, but I'm not sure that's the way to do it.

I think it makes more sense to put it down once you realize you haven't enjoyed it for longer than you have. For example, if you loved the first 50 pages but hated the next 140, it might just not be the book for you.

Learn what to stick with and learn what to put down, I think overall across your life you will enjoy reading much more.
