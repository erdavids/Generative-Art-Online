Is it strange to admit that I'm writing this post in the last couple minutes of the day just to keep my daily blogging streak going?

Overall this post isn't receiving a ton of my attention and very little preparation, so it's clearly not going to add a ton of value to my brand or any future readers. But it's still important for me to write.

I'm not sure if writing this particular post will have any direct value, but it will definitely help me write the next one. As long as I can keep writing, posts like this one will fall down into the list because they will simply be outranked by better posts.

So I'll let this one be bad, or rushed, or unprepared. That's okay. Better ones are on the way.
