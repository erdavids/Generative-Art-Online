It bothers me when people say, "If it was easy, everyone would do it."

I understand the merit, but it's just wrong. More people would do it, sure, but not everyone.

There are plenty of things now that everyone could do to improve not only their overall lives but their relationships, finances, physical fitness, education, sleep, understanding, relaxation... (The list kind of keeps going.)

The problem isn't that people are only avoiding hard things, and it's dangerous to make people feel like they need to do "hard" things in order to obtain any progress.

Writing a novel is hard. Writing a single word isn't. Start with the easy task, recognize that most people won't even do that, and take it from there. 

The hard things are just big bundles of easy ones anyway.
