Just like that, the year is half over. In many ways it has felt like one of the longest years of all time.

In other ways, it passed by even quicker than the ones that came before.

Regardless of how it feels, we're here now, halfway through another year, and we have the opportunity to plan out what the rest of the year should look like.

All the options are okay.

The rest of the year could be about recovery and relaxation after an extremely stressful start.

The rest of the year could be about finishing up even a couple of the projects you have sitting around, gathering attention.

The rest of the year could be about picking up a new skill and spending 10 minutes a day on it.

The rest of the year could be about developing a deeper relationship with just a couple of the people in your circle.

No matter what the rest of the year looks like for you, let it be intentional. Find the ways that put you in control of whatever outcome you want.

Life doesn't get any longer from here.
