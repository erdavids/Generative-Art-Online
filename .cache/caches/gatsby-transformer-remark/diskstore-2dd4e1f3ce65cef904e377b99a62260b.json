Whether it is the stepping block to another idea or simply something to help you steer clear of poor decisions, it deserves your respect.</p>\n<p>Don't dismiss your ideas with any of the common excuses, calling the idea either unoriginal, or too difficult, or too unreasonable, or too off brand.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, don't treat your ideas as these rare monoliths of inspiration that must be revered above all else.</p>\n<p>The ideas will continue to come to you in an endless stream of suffocating potential as long as you create the environment necessary for them to appear.</p>\n<p>The first part is to respect your ideas. They represent you. Write them down, preserve them, think them over.</p>\n<p>The second part is to let your ideas find you working.
